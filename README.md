# What Does AtomSmasher Do
- Before delivering AtomSmasher you'll have to run the RSA script to generate two keys, a private and public.
- Once AtomSmasher is on the targets computer It'll encrypt any file under the file_exts in the script  and bring up a ransome note in which the target would have to follow in order to obtain the key which would unlock the files.
